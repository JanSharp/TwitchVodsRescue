# Usage

## Setup

- Download this repo using the button at the top. Download the zip if you don't have git
- Open the [config.lua](config.lua) file and follow instructions for how to setup and configure the `downloader_cli` variable
- Open [configuration/readme.md](configuration/readme.md) and follow the steps there to setup the `configuration` folder

With that the script is setup to obtain nearly all metadata of your vods, as well as which collection each vod is apart of

## Executing

- Open a command line / terminal
- Change directory into the root of this project, the same folder this readme is in
  - use the `cd C:\path\to\this\folder` command on windows
  - on linux just right click open terminal here, pretty sure most file explorers have that, dolphin does anyway
- Run the command `./lua -- main.lua --help`
