# Usage

## Setup

- Download this repo using the `Code` button at the top. Download the zip and extract it if you don't have git
  - Note that wherever you put it it will download to a folder inside by default. There is an option to make it download to a different directory though if desired
- Open the [config.lua](config.lua) file and follow instructions for how to setup and configure the `downloader_cli` variable
- Open [configuration/readme.md](configuration/readme.md) and follow the steps there to setup the `configuration` folder
  - With that the script has nearly all metadata of your vods, as well as which collection each vod is apart of

## Executing

- Open a command line / terminal
- Change directory into the root of this project, the same folder this readme is in
  - Use the `cd C:\path\to\this\folder` command on Windows
  - On Linux just right click open terminal here, pretty sure most file explorers have that, dolphin does anyway
- Run the command `./lua -- main.lua --help`

## Notes and Tips

- When not given `--download-video` nor `--download-chat` the script will merely create metadata files
- The script creates sub directories for collections and uses a number prefix to sort them the same way they were sorted on twitch
- Every file which gets generated by the tool can be deleted individually and the script can regenerate that file alone. For example deleting the chat history but then wanting to redownload it does not require the script to redownload the entire video as well
- `--dry-run` is your friend if you'd like to have more confidence before running a command
- When closing the script while it is still running, it is almost guaranteed that a download got interrupted and cancelled by doing so. This leaves an empty file in the output folder which you _must delete manually_ otherwise the script will consider the file to already exist and therefore already downloaded
  - Take note of `--time-limit` option which can help avoid the manual intervention required as stated above, if you already know you only have a set amount of hours for example
