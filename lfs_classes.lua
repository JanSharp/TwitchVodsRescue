  ---Returns a table with the file attributes corresponding to filepath (or nil followed by an error message and a system-dependent error code in case of error). If the second optional argument is given and is a string, then only the value of the named attribute is returned (this use is equivalent to lfs.attributes(filepath)[request_name], but the table is not created and only one attribute is retrieved from the O.S.). if a table is passed as the second argument, it (result_table) is filled with attributes and returned instead of a new table. The attributes are described as follows; attribute mode is a string, all the others are numbers, and the time related attributes use the same time reference of os.time:

  ---Lua iterator over the entries of a given directory. Each time the iterator is called with dir_obj it returns a directory entry's name as a string, or nil if there are no more entries. You can also iterate by calling dir_obj:next(), and explicitly close the directory before the iteration finished with dir_obj:close(). Raises an error if path is not a directory.

Both times are provided in seconds (which should be generated with Lua standard function os.time). If the modification time is omitted, the access time provided is used; if both times are omitted, the current time is used.
